# PlanMyWeekend - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**PlanMyWeekend** is a modern React-based web application designed to help users discover, plan, and organize their weekend activities. The application features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, multiple viewing modes, and comprehensive weekend planning capabilities including support for both regular and long weekends.

## Major Design Decisions and Trade-offs

### 1. **Technology Stack Selection**

**Decision**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Rationale**: 
  - React for component-based architecture and excellent state management
  - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
  - Vite for fast development and optimized builds
  - Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistent design system

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Fast development, excellent developer experience, modern tooling
- ❌ **Cons**: Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with these technologies

### 2. **State Management Architecture**

**Decision**: React Context API instead of Redux or Zustand
- **Rationale**: 
  - Simpler state management for the application's scope
  - Built-in React solution reduces external dependencies
  - Sufficient for the current feature set

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: No additional dependencies, simpler mental model, easier testing
- ❌ **Cons**: Can become unwieldy with complex state updates, no built-in devtools

### 3. **Data Persistence Strategy**

**Decision**: Local Storage for data persistence
- **Rationale**:
  - No backend required for MVP
  - Fast access and offline capability
  - Simple implementation

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: No server costs, instant loading, works offline
- ❌ **Cons**: Data not synced across devices, limited storage capacity, no data backup

### 4. **Drag and Drop Implementation**

**Decision**: Custom drag and drop instead of react-beautiful-dnd
- **Rationale**:
  - More control over drag behavior
  - Better mobile touch support
  - Custom visual feedback during drag operations

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pros**: Full control, better mobile experience, custom animations
- ❌ **Cons**: More complex implementation, potential accessibility issues

## Component Design and State Management

### 1. **Component Architecture**

The application follows a modular component structure:

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── EventCard.tsx   # Event display component
│   ├── PlannerModal.tsx # Event selection modal
│   ├── LongWeekendPlanner.tsx # Main planning interface
│   └── ...
├── pages/              # Route-level components
│   ├── Home.tsx        # Landing page
│   ├── Explore.tsx     # Event discovery
│   ├── Planner.tsx     # Planning interface
│   └── Saved.tsx       # Saved events
├── context/            # State management
│   └── AppContext.tsx  # Global state provider
└── types/              # TypeScript definitions
    └── Event.ts        # Data models
```

### 2. **State Management Pattern**

**Centralized Context Pattern**:
- Single `AppContext` manages all application state
- Context provides both state and actions
- Local storage synchronization through useEffect hooks
- Optimistic updates for better UX

**Key State Entities**:
```typescript
interface AppContextType {
  savedEvents: Event[];
  favoritedEvents: Event[];
  weekendPlan: ExtendedWeekendPlan;
  savedWeekendPlans: ExtendedWeekendPlan[];
  // ... actions
}
```

### 3. **Component Design Principles**

**Reusability**: Components like `EventCard` are designed to work across different contexts (explore, planner, saved)

**Composition**: Complex components like `PlannerModal` use composition to handle different interaction modes

**Props Interface**: Clear, typed interfaces for all component props

**Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML

## Creative Features and Integrations

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. **Challenge: Complex Drag and Drop Implementation**

**Problem**: Implementing smooth drag and drop across different devices and browsers while maintaining accessibility

**Solution**:
- Custom implementation using native mouse and touch events
- Separate handling for desktop and mobile interactions
- Visual feedback system with drop zone highlighting
- Accessibility considerations with keyboard alternatives

**Code Example**:
```typescript
const handleDragStart = (event: Event, clientX: number, clientY: number) => {
  setDraggedEvent(event);
  setIsDragging(true);
  setDragCurrentPos({ x: clientX, y: clientY });
  // ... additional setup
};
```

### 2. **Challenge: State Synchronization Across Components**

**Problem**: Keeping multiple components in sync when weekend plans change

**Solution**:
- Centralized state management through React Context
- Single source of truth for all weekend data
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Automatic localStorage synchronization

### 3. **Challenge: Mobile Touch Support**

**Problem**: Ensuring drag and drop works smoothly on touch devices

**Solution**:
- Separate touch event handlers
- Touch-specific offset calculations
- Prevent default behaviors to avoid conflicts
- Visual feedback optimized for touch interactions

### 4. **Challenge: Canvas-Based Poster Generation**

**Problem**: Creating high-quality, theme-aware posters with dynamic content

**Solution**:
- Custom canvas drawing functions
- Dynamic sizing based on content
- Theme-aware color schemes
- Image loading with error handling
- Responsive canvas sizing

### 5. **Challenge: Type Safety with Complex Data Structures**

**Problem**: Maintaining type safety with flexible event and weekend plan structures

**Solution**:
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Union types for flexible data structures
- Type guards for runtime validation
- Generic components for reusability

**Code Example**:
```typescript
export interface ExtendedWeekendPlan extends WeekendPlan {
  theme?: "lazy" | "adventurous" | "family" | "romantic" | "cultural" | "active" | "social";
  isLongWeekend: boolean;
  startDate?: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  // ... additional properties
}
```

### 6. **Challenge: Performance with Large Event Lists**
